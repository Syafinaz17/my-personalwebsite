	<h2>ACADEMIC CLUB; ASSOCIATION OF INFORMATION SCIENTISTS (AIS)</h2>

	<p>If the committee members devote their complete devotion and attention to the club, a fantastic organisation will be developed. Whatever occurs, no one can find a pretext to sideline the club, since the secretariat line was applied to us by the then-club president. The truth is that through collaborating, we may not only learn how to run the organisation, but we can also discover our own strengths and flaws. During that period, we will do our best to improve our flaws and become a better human being than we were the day before. This is because a great person does not point out the flaws of others, but rather corrects his own.</p>
